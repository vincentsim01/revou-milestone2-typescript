🎲 Games
Revofun includes three unique games:

⚡ Magic Duel (Clicker Game)

A reimagined clicker game featuring Harris Poettra, a young wizard, battling against the evil wizard Koklemot.
Instead of a static button, a thunder-shaped arrow (created using CSS clip-path) grows in width when you click the Sim Salabim button.
Harris’s thunder bar grows with clicks, while Koklemot’s bar shrinks automatically using setInterval.
Difficulty increases with the Magic Duel level — intervals shrink based on a rational function progression (1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...).
Victory occurs when Harris’s thunder bar reaches 100% or Koklemot’s reaches 0.
On victory, a popup animation with Avada Kedavra (Hogwarts Legacy clip) appears to reward the player.
A summary popup shows the total number of clicks made.
Built with CSS Grid, Google Fonts, and images from Freepik.
🃏Kata-Kata Mutiara (Memory Card Game)

A cultural twist on the memory card game where instead of matching icons or logos, you match Indonesian wisdom phrases (kata mutiara).

The game board is divided into two rows:

Row 1 shows the first phrase
Row 2 shows the second phrase
Gameplay mechanics:

The game pulls from a nested array where each sub-array contains two items: [firstPhrase, secondPhrase].
Each card is assigned an id (based on the sub-array index) and stored in a dataset.
Cards initially display "?". When flipped, they reveal their phrase.
If a player selects two cards but they don’t match, a short setTimeout flips them back to "?".
Players cannot select two cards from the same row — if they try, it won’t count as a match and both will flip back.
A successful match (same id across Row 1 & Row 2) adds the match CSS class, turning the background green.
Extra polish:

CSS keyframes for smooth card flip animations
Sound effects for flip, selection, and matching
Countdown timer using setInterval.
Win/Lose Conditions:

Players must match 5 pairs of wisdom phrases before the countdown hits 0.
On winning, a popup appears to congratulate the player.
On losing (time runs out), a popup informs the player.
In both cases, players can restart the game, resetting the timer and board.
🔥🌊🌱 Duel Api Air Rumput (Fire–Water–Grass Duel)

A Pokémon-inspired twist on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

Based on the three basic starter elements from Pokémon: Fire, Water, and Grass.

Introduction Sequence

After clicking "Start", the game shows an intro scene to welcome the player.
Intro text smoothly disappears using setTimeout + CSS keyframe animation (translate upward + fade out).
Next, the character selection screen appears.
Character Selection

Players can choose a starter Pokémon from any generation (Red/Blue up to Scarlet/Violet).
Pokémon are stored in a nested array by generation and type:
[
  { generation: "Red/Blue", starters: { fire: "Charmander", water: "Squirtle", grass: "Bulbasaur" } },
  { generation: "Gold/Silver", starters: { fire: "Cyndaquil", water: "Totodile", grass: "Chikorita" } },
  ...
]
Using map and object keys, the system dynamically extracts and displays the selected Pokémon.
Battle Phase

Once a starter is chosen, the duel begins against a random opponent Pokémon (picked from the opponent array).
Player and opponent characters are shown with their names and images using template literals and innerHTML.
Player has 4 move buttons: 🔥 Fire, 🌊 Water, 🌱 Grass, and 👊 Physical.
Battle Logic

Opponent selects a move randomly.
Damage rules:
Fire 🔥 beats Grass 🌱 → Player deals 20 damage, receives 5 damage.
Grass 🌱 beats Water 🌊 → Player deals 20 damage, receives 5 damage.
Water 🌊 beats Fire 🔥 → Player deals 20 damage, receives 5 damage.
Same element → Both deal 10 damage.
Physical 👊 vs Physical 👊 → Both deal 3 damage.
Implementation uses addEventListener, if-else conditions, innerHTML, textContent, arrays, forEach, map, and classList.
A command log (bottom panel) updates each turn using setTimeout to simulate timed battle messages.
End Game

Battle continues until one character’s HP reaches 0.
A popup summary table appears showing:
Number of attacks by type
Count of super effective, effective, and physical hits
Player can retry, pick a new Pokémon, and restart the game.
